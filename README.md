To make it short:

Each column is x(1 starts from left).

Each row is y(1 starts from top).

Each 1 means its divideable by that number.

Currently its just a PoC and no input is possible.

The current number factorized is 24.

You can read from the map that the number is divideable by 24,12,8,6,4,3,2,1. (x read from top to down)


Future use would be to generate maps for 2^n (where n is the bit-width of the maximum possible number).

Currently those maps would be quite big, i'm looking for a way to make them smaller (or somehow find an even better way)

I'm not using a known algorithm, because i want to discover a new way of doing it.
